# Elementary probability on finite types

This file supplies a small, explicit probability foundation for the finite
random objects in the sparse-Fock argument.  A `FiniteLaw α` is a nonnegative
real weight on the finite type `α` whose total mass is one.  Expectations and
event probabilities are finite sums, so none of the results below hide
measurability, integrability, or independence hypotheses.

The main construction is `FiniteLaw.independentProduct`.  Its outcome is a
function `x : ι → α`, and its mass is the literal product of the coordinate
masses.  The coordinate marginal, separated-observable factorization, and
cylinder-event factorization theorems therefore give genuine mutual
independence of the coordinates.
